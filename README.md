# PitchBlackGTK
This is a pitch black gtk theme
i looked everywhere for something like this but found nothing
so i decided to create it from a template of another theme and just changing almost everything to black, grey and white

if you're looking for icons that match well with it, i recommend draucla-gtk-icons (u can find it in the aur if ur an arch user)
i can't think of a better alternative after trying so many of the icons out there
